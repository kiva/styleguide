At the beginning of a season there’s no way to know what crop yields will be. And since most farmers need to borrow money to afford inputs like seeds and fertilizers, there’s no guarantee that they’ll be able to repay regularly or as agreed. This leaves millions of farmers in a bind every year, facing livelihood-threatening obstacles.",
