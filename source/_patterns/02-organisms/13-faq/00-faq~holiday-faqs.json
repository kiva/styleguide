			   "question": "Why should I donate to Kiva?",
			   "answer": "Donations to Kiva's operating expenses are vital to the success and sustainability of Kiva. As an organization we’re committed to sending 100% of all loan contributions to borrowers. We don’t take a cut of money lent on our website, and don’t charge a fee for lending. <br> Instead, we primarily support our operations through optional donations from our lenders, who choose to donate in addition to their loans. By crowdfunding a large majority of our operational revenue through our lender community, we’re able to keep our fundraising costs low and be less reliant on larger, one-off gifts to be sustainable. We also raise some funds through grants, interest earned on our bank accounts, corporate sponsors and foundations."
