<!--
The subscriptions functionality is closely tied to the auto-deposit form.
For that reason the subscription content can be found in:
styleguide/source/_patterns/02-organisms/22-settings/01-auto-deposit-settings.mustache

The showing/hiding of subscriptions and auto-lending messaging is controlled by the following two variables:
("has_auto_deposit": true & "is_subscriber": true)
which are set in:
styleguide/source/_patterns/02-organisms/22-settings/01-auto-deposit-settings.json
-->

<p>The monthly good logic can be found in the 01-auto-deposit-settings.mustache file. Content is controlled
	by a {{#is_subscriber}}{{/is_subscriber}} & {{^is_subscriber}}{{/is_subscriber}} tags.</p>
