		Kiva is an international nonprofit,
		founded in 2005 and based in San Francisco,
		that celebrates and supports people looking to
		create a better future for themselves, their families
		and their communities. We exist to connect and empower
		them, one loan at a time.

		By lending as little as $25 on Kiva, anyone can help a borrower
		start or grow a business, go to school, access clean energy, or realize
		their potential. For some, it’s a
		matter of survival, for others it’s the fuel for a life-long ambition.
	</p>

	<p class="featured-medium-up">
		100% of every dollar you lend on Kiva goes to funding loans. Kiva covers
		costs primarily through optional
		donations, as well as through support from grants and sponsors.
