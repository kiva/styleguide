        	Kiva manages the Website, which matches you and other persons (each, a "Lender" and, collectively, "Lenders") with under-banked or low-income borrowers and social enterprises in various countries (each, a "Borrower" and, collectively, "Borrowers") in need of affordable capital.<strong> In most instances, these Borrowers are considered "high risk" by traditional lenders for a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the Borrowers' lack of credit history, the use of the loan proceeds for entrepreneurial endeavors including investment in a "start up" business, and the geographic location including the risk of financial instability and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Please carefully review the Website section entitled "Risk and Due Diligence" which highlights the various risks associated with lending online through Kiva and explains in greater detail the role played by Kiva and the Field Partners (defined below in this Section 1).
        </p>
        <p>
        	By participating in the Program or otherwise accessing or using the Website, you hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) Kiva makes no representation, warranty, covenant or guarantee that any funds you lend to a Borrower via the Website will be repaid in whole or in part, (b) loans and other similar transactions made via the Website (each, a "Loan") are unsecured and bear a high risk of non-repayment and (c) given your financial situation and objectives, you will lend only those amounts on the Website that you can afford to lose. Loans made via the Website are philanthropic in nature with no offered rate of return and, as such, are not intended as, and cannot be considered as, an investment in a financial instrument or security.  Loans made via the withebsite are not cancellable or refundable by the User.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.1  Loan Disbursement.</strong>
            You understand that Loans are not made directly to Borrowers and that Kiva identifies existing domestic and international organizations (each, a "Field Partner" and, collectively, "Field Partners") that work in underbanked or low-income communities and generally have a stated mission to reduce poverty by providing affordable working capital to underbanked or low-income borrowers. Loan requests are posted in cooperation with such Field Partners and are, before being listed on Kiva, converted to US Dollar amounts as necessary and then rounded up to the nearest US Dollar increment of 25, to help streamline the Loan transaction process. Funds loaned by you, the Lender, will be delivered to Field Partners for ultimate disbursement to, or backfilling of Loans to, the Borrower(s) you have selected. In certain cases, Borrowers may receive goods and services funded by Loan amounts, such as agricultural packages, from Field Partners, instead of the monetary amount of the Loan. A Field Partner may voluntarily choose to pre-fund your Borrower in the short-reduce the time the Borrower needs to wait until the Loan is funded on the Website and the funds are delivered on a net billing basis to the Field Partner. Kiva serves as a middle-man in the process and aggregates funds from multiple Lenders via the Website and delivers 100% of these funds on a net billing basis (excluding the interest earned, if any, on such funds while they are held in a Kiva user loan funds account, which interest is contributed to fund Kiva's operations) to the Field Partner(s) for disbursement to the Borrowers selected by Lenders for funding on the Website. Please note that many Field Partners require mandatory savings as part of their transaction process to serve as collateral, which savings may help ensure that Borrowers are able to accumulate cash and represent a good risk. In certain cases, mandatory savings (and fees) are netted by Field Partners against the Loans forwarded by Kiva.
        </p>
        <p>
        	<strong>1.2  Loan Collection and Repayment.</strong>
        	Loans are repaid directly by the Borrower(s) to the Field Partner(s). As Borrowers repay the Loans, the Field Partner(s) will post a record to the Website of such repayments actually received by the Field Partner(s), and it is the responsibility and obligation of the applicable Field Partner(s) to pay over such collected Loan payments to Kiva.In some cases (for example, for Loans in India), the records of repayments are not posted on the Website as the Borrowers repay the Loans, as a result of certain system and country regulatory constraints.  Repayments may be made in periodic installments, depending on the terms of the applicable Loan. <strong>In some cases (for example, for Loans in India), repayments may only be provided at the end of a fixed term (for example, after 43 months), as a result of certain system and country regulatory constraints.</strong> Except as may be provided in Sections 1.5 ("Principal Loss Scenarios"), Section 1.9 ("Promotional Products"), Section 1.10 (“Free Trial Feature”), Section 1.12 (Bonuses Feature”), Section 1.13 (“Donor Advised Fund”) and Section 1.14 (“Dedicate a Loan Feature”) below, any amounts actually received by Kiva from a Field Partner(s) as repayment by the applicable Borrower(s) will be distributed among the Lenders on a pro rata basis in accordance with the amounts loaned by such Lenders to such Borrower(s). These distributions may, in Kiva's sole discretion, be made periodically or in one lump sum once 100% of all Loan proceeds for a particular Loan have been received by Kiva. Furthermore, please note that timing of distributions to Lenders of any collected repayment may vary and may be materially impacted because of circumstances that, in Kiva's judgment, require Kiva to conduct further reviews with respect to the collected repayments (by way of one example, to resolve issues regarding accuracy of repayment amounts and corresponding data, or for other issues). If, for any reason, the Field Partner(s) are unable to collect Loan repayments directly from the Borrowers or if Kiva, for any reason, is unable to collect Loan repayments directly from the Field Partner(s), repayment of your Loan amounts could be at risk of partial or total delay or non-repayment and a loss of some or all of your principal could occur. You hereby acknowledge and agree that neither the Field Partner(s) nor the Borrower(s) will have direct contractual obligation or liability to pay you any principal and that Kiva is obligated to repay only such Loan principal to the extent actually received by Kiva from a Field Partner with respect to a Borrower (subject to the conditions noted above). None of Kiva, its Field Partner(s) or any Borrower will have any obligation to pay interest on the Loan or other fees or amounts (other than as expressly set forth above) to you or any other Lender in connection with any Loan you make. At this time, Kiva does not charge interest on any Loans posted on the Website. However, you should note that Field Partners charge interest and fees to Borrowers to, for example, cover their operational expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.3 Tax Deductibility.</strong> You understand that Kiva is a non-profit public benefit corporation. Kiva has received exemption with the Internal Revenue Service as an organization that qualifies as a public charity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. You acknowledge, however, that because you are making a Loan and not donating any money, you are not eligible to receive a tax deduction as might otherwise be available in connection with a charitable contribution to a tax-exempt public charity.<b> You also understand that you are solely responsible for determining the proper tax treatment for any Loan you make through the Website and the Program. Kiva has not and will not provide any tax or legal advice to you in connection with any Loan you might make.</b> This Agreement does not attempt to define the tax implications of participating in the Program. If you participate in the Program, you should consult with your own accountants, tax advisors and legal advisors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.4 Loan Records.</strong> Records of each Loan you make (including this Agreement and any repayment history) are kept by Kiva and, if you have a registered account with Kiva and upon your written request, will be made available to you at any time throughout the term of the Loan. The amount of funds you have available in your Kiva account that you have deposited -- whether from your personal funds or value from a Kiva Card microloan product -- and is freely available to be lent ("Kiva Credit") can also be accessed via your Kiva online account created upon registering at the Website.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.5 Principal Loss Scenarios.</strong> You understand and hereby consent (without any prior notice thereof) to any restructuring of the repayment plan for your Loan and/or, in Kiva's sole discretion, any extension of the length of the term of your Loan in order to increase the chances that your Loan is repaid or that amounts of your Loan are repaid. Kiva will generally deem a Loan to be in default if Kiva determines that collection of funds from a Field Partner for such Loan is doubtful or the cumulative amount repaid as of a quarterly reconciliation is less than the amount expected as of six (6) months prior, although case by case differences may exist based on pending prospects for repayment of the Loan and depending on country context and related system and regulatory constraints. In cases where a Loan is in default, and subject to the distribution timing provisions noted in Section 1.2 (Loan Collection and Repayment) above, each applicable Lender will have the option to recover whatever principal has been repaid up to that point.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Loans made in local currencies other than the US Dollar, Kiva gives Field Partners the option to have Lenders share the risk of principal losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Field Partners may require Lenders to bear any losses due to the appreciation of the US Dollar by over 10% relative to the local currency in which the Loan was made.  The loan profile for each Loan on the Website specifies whether the applicable Field Partner will cover all losses from currency fluctuations, or whether Lenders will be required to share the risk of currency exchange rate losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            If for any reason less than 100% of your Loan is repaid, you agree that Kiva and its Field Partners (as well as any "related Field Partner entity" –  for example, one that as part of a restructuring or otherwise, assumes control over such a Field Partner, its assets and/or its obligations) shall have no liability therefor, and you hereby release and forever hold harmless Kiva and its Field Partners and any "related Field Partner entity" for any loss you may incur. You should consult with your accountant and/or tax advisors to determine the appropriate tax treatment of such a loss.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.6 Insufficient Lender Funds.</strong> In the event that you make a Loan and your payment does not clear (e.g., an eCheck does not validly deliver to Kiva the full amount of the intended Loan, or your payment provider reverses a payment originally intended for Kiva), you agree that Kiva may, in its sole discretion, (i) offset the amount of the insufficiently funded Loan against your Kiva Credit or (ii) withdraw and cancel your insufficiently-funded Loan from your account as not paid in full.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.7 Auto-lending; "Pick a Loan" Feature.</strong>Without in any way limiting the earlier provisions of this Section 1, Kiva may implement Website features pursuant to which a User may – in lieu of manually accessing his or her registered account to specify a Loan or Loans to make – establish account settings to automatically make Loans based on the User's prior instructions and without further direct input from the User, based on User-selected preferences, the amount of Kiva Credit available in the User's account, and other business factors, such as the availability of Loans on the Website and other parameters as may be determined by Kiva in its sole discretion. To the extent a User chooses to activate the auto-lending feature on the User's registered account (whether by manually changing settings by logging into a User’s account, activating auto-lending via more automated tools that Kiva may offer from time to time such as via email or other electronic communications, or by otherwise contacting Kiva), and depending on the particular preferences selected by the User, any and all available Kiva Credit at any time in such User's account (including, but not limited to, repayments on previously made Loans or new Kiva Credit otherwise deposited into the User's account) may be subject to being automatically deployed under the auto-lending program. You understand and acknowledge, however, that a User's activation of the auto-lending choice on such User's account does not necessarily guarantee that Loans will be successfully made. Variables such as a User's particular set of auto-lending preferences, or the general availability of Loans not already funded through manual selection by other Kiva Users, or other feature parameters as established by Kiva in its sole discretion, may impact the chances of an automatic Loan being made. You further acknowledge and agree that any Loans transacted under the auto-lending feature are in all respects Loans voluntarily made by you as the User, based on your instructions as reflected in your preference settings simply executed by the Kiva system and subject to overall availability of Loans and other feature parameters, and are under no circumstances to be considered to be Loans chosen by Kiva on such User's behalf. Furthermore, in no event will a Loan made pursuant to the auto-lending feature, by a User who has chosen to activate the auto-lending feature, be cancellable or refundable by the User. You agree that Kiva and its Field Partners shall have no liability if for any reason less than 100% of a Loan made pursuant to auto-lending is repaid, and you hereby release and forever hold harmless Kiva and its Field Partners for any loss you may incur from an auto-lending Loan. Kiva may modify or terminate the auto-lending functionality at any time or from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without in any way limiting the earlier provisions of this Section 1, Kiva may implement Website features pursuant to which a User may ask to have the Website randomly suggest a particular Loan for the User to consider making. To the extent a User employs this 'pick a loan' suggestion feature, you understand and acknowledge that you have an opportunity to learn more about that Loan before deciding whether or not to fund such Loan and that you have complete discretion to decline to fund such Loan. You further acknowledge and agree that any Loans transacted under the 'pick a loan' suggestion feature are in all respects Loans voluntarily made by you as the User. You agree that Kiva and its Field Partners shall have no liability if for any reason less than 100% of a Loan made pursuant to the 'pick a loan' feature is repaid, and you hereby release and forever hold harmless Kiva and its Field Partners for any loss you may incur from a Loan suggested by the 'pick a loan' feature. Kiva may modify or terminate the 'pick a loan' suggestion functionality at any time or from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>1.8 User Account Inactivity; Instructions for Auto-Donation of Funds to Kiva or Auto-Withdrawal Return of Funds to User; Potential Escheatment of Funds.</strong> Kiva welcomes its Users' active participation in the Kiva Program. However, there may be occasions when a User becomes "inactive" for an extended period of time – i.e., a User does not log in to his or her Kiva account (or otherwise indicate to Kiva a desire to keep the account active – for example, through a phone or email communication with Kiva or by taking advantage of embedded response features, such as clicking on a click response button, in an email or other electronic communication from Kiva) or there are no credits/withdrawals made to such User's account. Therefore, Kiva may implement Website features pursuant to which you may instruct Kiva in advance as to how you wish any remaining balances in your account to be handled in the event your account were to become inactive for a period of 24 or more consecutive months -- namely, whether in such a case of User inactivity, you (i) wish to automatically donate remaining funds in your account to Kiva's general operating expenses to further Kiva's philanthropic mission or (ii) wish for Kiva to return remaining funds in your account to you via Kiva's standard account withdrawal process.  In addition, in such cases of User inactivity, Kiva may elect to automatically terminate the inactive User account.
        </p>
        <p> 
             <u>For Users who have joined Kiva prior to 12:00PM on June 14, 2010:</u> if you wish to take advantage of this feature, you must first affirmatively instruct Kiva by opting in to one of the two choices (i.e., auto-donation to Kiva or auto-withdrawal return to User).
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>For Users who join Kiva on or after 12:00PM on June 14, 2010:</u> you will upon registration on the Website automatically be opted-in to instructing Kiva to auto-convert any remaining account balances as a donation to Kiva's general operating expenses to further Kiva's philanthropic mission if your account were to become inactive for a period of 24 or more consecutive months. Please note that you are free to change this pre-set option in your discretion and at any time in advance (although you understand any funds that have been auto-donated based on the then-existing preference setting shall not be revocable once the auto-donation has taken place).
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event that your account shows no activity for an extended period of time and (i) you have not indicated an instruction to Kiva through an inactivity preference selection described above or (ii) your instructions to have remaining balances returned to you cannot be successfully completed, whether due to invalid/incomplete information, your failure to claim the funds after thirty (30) calendar days have passed from the day Kiva has forwarded the funds to you, a return of funds back to Kiva as unclaimed after Kiva has attempted to forward your funds to you, or for any other reason internal or external to Kiva, then Kiva may determine it is appropriate to forward (i.e., escheat) the balance remaining in your inactive Kiva account to the state government of your state of residency. In such a case, Kiva will determine your residency based on the state listed in your mailing address information that may have previously been made available to us. If your address is unknown or is outside of the USA, Kiva may then find it is appropriate to forward (escheat) your funds to the State of California. If your funds are escheated to a state authority, you would have to contact the relevant state's unclaimed property administrator to reclaim such funds.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.9 Promotional Products.</strong> Kiva may offer certain promotions and promotional products to Users.  Any specific terms posted by Kiva with respect to such promotions and promotional products, as well as this Agreement, shall apply to all Users’ participation in the promotion and use of promotional products.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.10 Free Trial Feature.</strong> You are eligible to make one (1) free trial loan on the Website through the free trial loan feature (“Free Trial Feature”) if:
        <ul class="termsofuse">
            <li>You are currently not a registered User or if you are currently a registered User, you have not previously conducted a transaction in association with your Kiva account, including without limitation making a donation, buying a Kiva Card, redeeming a Kiva Card, making a loan and making a deposit.</li>
            <li>You register on the Website as a new User via a Free Trial Feature URL link.</li>

            <li>You are at least 18 years old.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Supplies of free-trial microloan credits are strictly limited and are available to be claimed only while supplies last. Receiving an invitation to use the Free Trial Feature does not guarantee that a free trial loan will be available by the time you choose to attempt to make a free trial loan on the Website. Free-trial microloan credits will be made available on a “first claimed” basis. By participating in the Free Trial Feature through use of a free-trial microloan credit or by otherwise making a loan via a Free Trial Feature URL link, you fully and unconditionally agree to be bound by this Agreement. Free-trial microloan credits cannot be used for any purpose other than making a loan on the Website and the time for use of free-trial microloan credits cannot be extended. Such credit is not transferable and may not be exchanged. The value of such credit may not be substituted or exchanged for cash or other product or service. No replacement free-trial microloan credits can be offered (and no other compensation will be provided), including without limitation, in the event a free trial loan is refunded, becomes delinquent, or defaults.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you make a free trial loan on the Website through the Free Trial Feature, you understand that any repayments on such loan will not be returned to you, but will instead automatically be returned to a Kiva affiliate for future use to help further Kiva’s charitable mission or the then-applicable Kiva supporter sponsoring the Free Trial Feature. The maker of a free trial loan will not receive – and will not be entitled to – repayments made (if any) or any other reimbursement or consideration on such loan. Furthermore, any automatic return of repayments to a Kiva affiliate from any loan you make with free-trial microloan credit funds does not qualify as a charitable donation to Kiva.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any applicable Federal, state and local taxes with respect to the free-trial microloan credits are the sole responsibility of the recipient. Any additional costs incurred in claiming the Kiva free-trial microloan credit are the User’s sole responsibility. All determinations with respect to eligibility to participate in the Free Trial Feature (including, but not limited to, the ability to make a free trial loan through free-trial microloan credits) under this Free Trial Feature shall be made solely by Kiva in its sole discretion and all Kiva determinations and decisions shall be final. Any User determined to be using multiple emails under this Free Trial Feature (whether to make multiple free trial loans or otherwise) will be immediately disqualified from this Free Trial Feature without notice. The Free Trial Feature is not valid where prohibited by law, and is subject to all applicable Federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations. Kiva accepts no responsibility or liability in connection with any loss or damages incurred by you in connection with receipt or use of such free-trial microloan credit. By using the Free Trial Feature through a free-trial microloan credit or otherwise making a loan via a Free Trial Feature URL link, you agree to release and hold harmless Kiva from any and all liability for loss, harm, damage, injury, cost or expense whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
            ANY ATTEMPT TO DELIBERATELY DEFRAUD KIVA OR OTHERWISE UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION AND PROCESS OF THE FREE TRIAL FEATURE IS A VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY APPLICABLE LAWS.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.11 Kiva API.</strong>  The Kiva API is a service that Kiva provides to allow third parties to develop and offer applications, services and features using information from the Website and Program (“Third Party Applications”).  Third Party Applications are not created or maintained by Kiva but by third parties.  These third parties’ terms of service and privacy policies govern your use of Third Party Applications.  Any authorization you give to any third party or Third Party Application to take actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement.  Kiva gives no guarantees or warranties with respect to any Third Party Application and is not responsible for your use or inability to use any Third Party Application, including without limitation the content, accuracy, reliability or security of Third Party Applications or the privacy practices or other policies of third parties.  To revoke permissions that you have granted to a Third Party Application, you may revoke these permissions by logging into your account on the Website or by contacting Kiva. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.12 Bonuses Feature.</strong> From time to time, Kiva may offer features in which some or all registered Users are eligible to receive bonuses pursuant to which a User (i) may make an additional microloan on the Website without requiring such registered User to spend his or her own Kiva Credit of deposited funds or (ii) may make a subsidized microloan on the Website whereby such registered User’s use of his or her own Kiva Credit of deposited funds is supplemented by the value of the bonuses (collectively, “Bonuses”).  For example, under one possible Bonus feature, registered Users who successfully invite individuals:
        <ul class="termsofuse">
        <li>who have not previously registered as a User;</li>
        <li>who ultimately register on the Website and successfully make a Loan on Kiva; and</li>
        <li>who confirm your status as being the inviter of the new Lender (e.g., by the new Lender’s clicking on the relevant invitation link or by identifying you as the inviter in the new Lender’s registration process)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            could then be eligible to receive (claim) Bonuses which may be used for a limited time to make an additional microloan on the Website without requiring such registered User inviter to spend his or her own Kiva Credit.  Please note that programs for Bonuses may have differing eligibility and claiming criteria or requirements and that the subsidy value of the Bonuses may also vary by program.
        </p>
        <p>
            Supplies of Bonuses are strictly limited and are available to be claimed only while supplies last on a “first claimed” basis.  Receiving an offer to participate in a Bonuses feature does not guarantee that any Bonuses will be available for you to claim by the time you have satisfied the relevant requirements and criteria.  If Bonuses are available to be claimed, the Bonuses will automatically be deposited into your Kiva account at the time you have successfully fulfilled the criteria or requirements.  Bonuses may be used to make microloans on Kiva for a strictly limited period of time (as described in the particular program) after they are first deposited into the qualifying User’s Kiva account.
        </p>
        <p>
            To the extent that you have Bonuses in your account when you make a loan on Kiva (excluding any loans made by auto-lending), your available Bonuses will be used first in order of lending allocation priority, followed by funds you have deposited into your account.  Please note that Kiva, in its sole discretion, may place limits or restrictions on the categories and types of loans (e.g., risk rating of Field Partner, term of loan or restricting Bonuses from use with auto-lending) that may be made when using Bonuses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bonuses cannot be used for any purpose other than making a loan on the Website during the eligibility period of the Bonuses successfully claimed, and the time for use of Bonuses cannot be extended.  Such Bonuses may not be substituted or exchanged for cash or other products or services.  No replacement Bonuses can be offered (and no other compensation will be provided), including without limitation, in the event a loan made with Bonuses is refunded, becomes delinquent or defaults.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you make a loan utilizing Bonuses, you understand that any repayments on such loan will not be returned to you, but will instead automatically be returned either to a Kiva affiliate for future use to help further Kiva’s charitable mission or the then-applicable Kiva supporter sponsoring a given Bonuses program.  A lender making a loan with Bonuses will not receive – and will not be entitled to – repayments (if any) or any other reimbursement or consideration on the portion of such loan the Lender funded using the Bonuses.  Furthermore, any automatic return of repayments to a Kiva affiliate from any loan you make with Bonuses does not qualify as a charitable donation to Kiva.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any applicable Federal, state and local taxes with respect to the Bonuses are the sole responsibility of the User.  Any additional costs incurred in claiming the Bonuses are the User’s sole responsibility. All determinations with respect to eligibility to participate in the Bonuses feature (including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of criteria to claim Bonuses) shall be made solely by Kiva in its sole discretion and all Kiva determinations and decisions shall be final. Any User determined to be in breach of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, defrauding (or attempting to defraud) this Bonuses feature) is subject to being disqualified from receiving Bonuses and/or forfeiting all received Bonuses without notice, in addition to all other remedies available to Kiva under this Agreement and under applicable laws. The Bonuses feature is not valid where prohibited by law, and is subject to all applicable Federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations. Kiva accepts no responsibility or liability in connection with any loss or damages incurred by you in connection with receipt or use of such Bonuses. By participating in or otherwise using the Bonuses, you agree to release and hold harmless Kiva from any and all liability, for loss, harm, damage, injury, cost or expense whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
            ANY ATTEMPT TO DELIBERATELY DEFRAUD KIVA OR OTHERWISE UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION AND PROCESS OF THE BONUSES FEATURE IS A VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY APPLICABLE LAWS.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.13 Donor Advised Fund.</strong>  Kiva may choose to operate one or more donor advised funds (each such fund a “DAF”) in furtherance of the organization’s charitable mission.  From time to time, Users may become eligible to participate on the Kiva platform – such as via free trial loans or loans via Bonuses as described above – by exercising advisory privileges over certain funds donated to a Kiva DAF (“DAF Funds”).  In such cases, a User understands and agrees that (i) the recommendation made by selecting a loan to be supported with DAF Funds (whether via free trial loans, Bonuses, or other features that Kiva may offer from time to time) is advisory in nature only and that final discretion in the deployment of any DAF Funds ultimately rests with Kiva by law and (ii) such a User shall not exercise advisory privileges to satisfy a personal pledge or obligation or in a manner which results in any impermissible private benefit to the User, the funding donor of the applicable DAF Funds, or any of such funder’s affiliates.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.14 Dedicate a Loan Feature.</strong> Users have the option to “Dedicate a Loan” at checkout.  This feature allows a User to make a Loan in someone else’s honor (a “Dedicated Loan”), with any repayments going to support Kiva’s general operating expenses.  If you choose to dedicate a Loan, you understand that any repayments with respect to such Dedicated Loan will not be returned to you, but will instead automatically be donated to Kiva to help further Kiva’s charitable mission.  Each incremental Dedicated Loan repayment amount shall be treated as a donation by the purchaser of the Dedicated Loan to Kiva as of the date such repayment is received.  The maker of a Dedicated Loan will not receive – and will not be entitled to – any repayments made (if any) or any other reimbursement or consideration for the Dedicated Loan.

The Website may not be accessed or used by you in connection with any other endeavors -- commercial or otherwise -- except as previously approved in writing by an authorized representative of Kiva. Your access and use of the Website and participation in the Program shall be in strict compliance with this Agreement, including, without limitation, Kiva's Privacy Policy, all other procedures and guidelines set forth on the Website and as part of the Program, as well as applicable law. You may not use the Website in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the Website or software, systems or equipment of Kiva, any User, Field Partner or any other person.  You may not use the Website in any manner that, in Kiva’s sole discretion, creates a poor user experience for any other User, such as by posting content specifically designed to attract a negative reaction from an individual or group, or by “keyword stuffing” lending team pages (loading a page description with keywords in an attempt to manipulate the page’s ranking in search results).  You may not engage in advertising to, or solicitation of, any User, Field Partner, Borrower or any other person to buy or sell any products or services through the Website. Only authorized Field Partners and their authorized Borrowers may seek Loans on the Website or otherwise through the Program. You may not transmit any chain letters, junk email or "spam" to any User, Field Partner, Borrower or any other person. Kiva has the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action (including, without limitation, civil, criminal and injunctive redress) against any illegal and/or unauthorized uses of the Website or exploitations of the Program, including collecting or harvesting (whether or not by automated scripts) the name, email address or any other personal or confidential information of any User, Field Partner, Borrower or any other person by electronic or other means for any reason, including, without limitation, the purpose of sending unsolicited email and unauthorized framing of or linking to the Website.

In order to protect such persons from such advertising, solicitation or harassment, Kiva reserves the right to remove content from the Website that violates acceptable use in Kiva's sole discretion and restrict the number of emails or messages that a User may send to others through the Website in any 24-hour or other period to a number that Kiva deems appropriate, in Kiva's sole and absolute discretion.

Without in any way limiting the foregoing, it is a violation of this Agreement to post, upload, submit, transmit or otherwise share any content, including, but not limited to, written materials or images, that in Kiva's opinion is obscene, harassing, contains profanity, or may be hateful or offensive on racial, ethnic, sexual or any other grounds; is harmful, vulgar or distasteful; contains graphic or gratuitous violence; or is defamatory, libelous, or invades another person's privacy or proprietary rights.
