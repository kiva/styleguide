			Kiva Trustees source entrepreneurs they believe in and publicly endorse them as borrowers on the Kiva website.
		</p>
		<p class="small-text">
			Trustees have no financial liability for loans, but their reputation is tied to the repayment rate of the borrowers they endorse. Unlike on the main Kiva website, trustees never actually handle the loans, which Kiva disburses directly to the borrowers. Trustees can be individuals or organizations.
