    <p>* Please note, Kiva is continually adding and ending partnerships as we deem necessary. This means, you may end up supporting a loan in a country or through a Field Partner that is no longer active and therefore not included in the total number of countries or partners noted on this page. For this reason, it is possible to see discrepancies between the number you've supported and the number to go.</p>
