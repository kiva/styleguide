  "directLoanPurpose": [
    "We see the most potential for expansion in the near future and most need of funding in our Farmers Markets and outdoor farm sites. We hope to use this loan to buy 10 truckloads of organic soil to further develop our outdoor farms, and two additional vans that will enable us to attend more markets next season, as well as help us expand other aspects of our farm.",
    "Soil: Premium organic soil is one of the highest costs to our business. With about ⅜ of an acre currently productive out of a total of 3.5 acres available at our two outdoor farms, there is a lot of potential for further development. We would like to build out an additional ¼ acre at each farm, which would require enough soil for ½ acre total. Based on our experience from building the farms last year, this would cost a total of $6,000."
