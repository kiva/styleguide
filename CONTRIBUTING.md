# Contributing to the Kiva Lender Website Styleguide

Kiva appreciates any interest you may have in making contributions
to our styleguide.

However, please be aware that as a nonprofit organization with highly constrained
technical staff resources, we have very limited capacity to engage with
potential contributors or to evaluate contributions for suitability, unless we
have specifically invited a particular contribution.

Before expending significant effort on something you might like to contribute
to our styleguide, we invite you to [join our Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/build-kiva)
and open a discussion regarding the contribution you'd like to make. And
please forgive us too if we are less responsive than we would like to be to
communications via the Google group.

For contributions we have expressed an interest in receiving, please fork
this repository and submit a pull request when your contribution is ready
for our consideration.
