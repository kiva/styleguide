People 60 years old and older in El Salvador have limited access to credit, even when fully physically and mentally capable of working. The reason is insurance companies don’t cover people who are over 65 and require them to show a health certificate if they are over 60. This potential for health expenses makes financial institutions less willing to take on the risk of the loan. By funding this loan, you are helping elderly people access opportunities in El Salvador.</span>",
