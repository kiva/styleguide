			   "question": "Why should I donate to Kiva?",
			   "answer": "Donations to Kiva's operating expenses are vital to the success and sustainability of Kiva. As an organization we’re committed to sending 100% of all loan contributions to borrowers. We don’t take a cut of money lent on our website, and don’t charge a fee for lending.<br /><br /> Instead, we primarily support our operations through optional donations from our lenders, who choose to donate in addition to their loans. By crowdfunding a large majority of our operational revenue through our lender community, we’re able to keep our fundraising costs low and be less reliant on larger, one-off gifts to be sustainable. We also raise some funds through grants, interest earned on our bank accounts, corporate sponsors and foundations."

			   "question": "How does Kiva use donations?",
			   "answer": "Kiva's staff and volunteers work hard to ensure every dollar donated to Kiva is used efficiently. For every $1 donated, Kiva facilitates $8 in loans!<br /><br /> Donations support a variety of programs, including:<br /><br /> -- Sending expert staff to over 80 countries to cultivate new partnerships, expand Kiva’s reach and perform due diligence and monitoring.<br /> -- Building and maintaining the complex technical infrastructure that facilitates over $1 million in loans each week.<br /> -- Training and supporting several hundred volunteers who translate and edit every loan posted on the Kiva website.<br /> -- Supporting the needs of our valued lenders around the world, developing engagement programs and answering customer service inquiries.<br /><br /> To learn more about how we use donations, check out our <a href='https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=12978'>Charity Navigator</a> profile or most recent <a href='{kvurl page=annualreport action=showCurrent}'>Annual Report</a>."

We, unfortunately, don't have tax-deductible status in any other countries at this time."
