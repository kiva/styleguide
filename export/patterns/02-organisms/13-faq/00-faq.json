			   "question": "Do I need to fund the entire loan?",
			   "answer": "No, Kiva crowdfunds loans so there are many individual lenders who come together to contribute to each successful loan. You can lend $25 or more to a borrower to help them reach their goal, and you can see the other lenders who supported that borrower at the bottom of the loan profile."

		  {
			   "id": "faq-2",
			   "question": "Will I get repaid?",
			   "answer": "Kiva loans have a historical repayment rate of 98%, but Kiva does not guarantee repayment for any loans crowdfunded on the Kiva website.</br></br>Past repayment performance does not guarantee future results, and Kiva lenders should be aware of the different layers of risk (such as borrower risk, country risk and currency risk) that could lead to losing some or all of the lender’s principal. You can read more at <a href='http://www.kiva.org/about/risk' target='_blank'>Risks of Lending.</a>"

			   "question": "Who can get a Kiva loan?",
			   "answer": "Kiva crowdfunds loans for borrowers in more than 80 countries who are often financially excluded and can’t access other fair and affordable sources of credit. In the U.S., Kiva crowdfunds loans for borrowers who are either financially excluded or creating social impact in their communities.</br></br>Kiva borrowers work in many industries. They may be farmers, artisans, students, shopkeepers, builders or restaurant owners. Many Kiva borrowers work multiple jobs to generate enough income to support their families.</br></br>Kiva Field Partners and Trustees help identify and vet borrowers whose loans will be crowdfunded on Kiva. If you’re in the the U.S. and you’re interested in applying for a loan you can learn more <a href='https://www.kiva.org/borrow' target='_blank'>here</a>."

			   "id": "faq-4",
			   "question": "How do borrowers get on the Kiva website?",
			   "answer": "Depending on the type of loan, a local Field Partner or the borrower uploads the details for each loan into the system. Kiva’s worldwide network of volunteers then helps to edit and translate loans before they go live on the website for lenders to crowdfund.</br></br>Learn more about our due diligence process for Field Partners and borrowers <a href='http://www.kiva.org/about/due-diligence' target='_blank'>here</a>."

			   "id": "faq-5",
			   "question": "Do Kiva and/or Kiva lenders receive interest on Kiva loans?",
			   "answer": "Kiva never collects interest on loans and individual Kiva lenders do not receive interest from loans they support on Kiva."
