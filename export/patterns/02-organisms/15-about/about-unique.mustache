				We believe lending alongside thousands of
				others is one of the most powerful and
				sustainable ways to create economic and social
				good. Lending on Kiva creates a partnership of
				mutual dignity and makes it easy to touch more
				lives with the same dollar. Fund a loan, get
				repaid, fund another.

				Whether you lend to friends in your community,
				or people halfway around the world (and for many,
				it’s both), Kiva creates the opportunity to play
				a special part in someone else's story. At Kiva,
				loans aren’t just about money—they’re a way to
				create connection and relationships.

				Kiva started as a pioneer in crowdfunding
				in 2005, and is constantly innovating to
				meet people’s diverse lending needs. Whether
				it’s reinventing microfinance with more
				flexible terms, supporting community-wide
				projects or lowering costs to borrowers, we
				are always testing and learning.

				When a Kiva loan enables someone to grow a
				business and create opportunity for themselves,
				it creates opportunities for others as well.
				That ripple effect can shape the future for a
				family or an entire community.
