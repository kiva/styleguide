	<p>At Kiva, we know that starting and running your business leaves little time for other things. As your Kiva payments impact your business credit score, we want to make your life as easy as possible when it comes to making payments on time. That is why we are now offering a new way of making your loan repayments.</p>
	</br>
	<p>Sign up once to automatically repay through PayPal based on your repayment schedule and never have to worry about it again. Donâ€™t worry - we will still remind you well in advance when your repayment will be made, and when it is made. You will always be able to view your repayment schedule, and can edit / pause your automated repayments at any time.</p>
