Kiva offers Field Partners the option to protect themselves against severe currency fluctuations (a US dollar appreciation of over 10% relative to the local currency) by sharing any losses greater than 10% with Kiva lenders. By bearing these losses, lenders are able to protect the Field Partner and its borrowers from catastrophic currency devaluations."

Many of Kiva's Field Partners do charge interest to borrowers, and you can find more information about these rates by looking at the Average Cost to Borrower field on each partner page (kiva.org/partners) as well as on each loan profile. These rates vary by country and partner."
